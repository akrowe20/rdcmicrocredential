METADATA of TetraDENSITY 2.0

Reference: Santini et al. TetraDENSITY 2.0 – A database of population density estimates in Tetrapods. Global Ecology and Biogeography

Collector = Person who collected the data

Class = Taxonomic class

Order = Taxonomic order

Species COL = Binomial standardized using Catalogue of Life

Species_rep = Binomial reported in the study

Subspecies_rep = Subspecies

Year = Sampling year(s). Expressed as a range when the sampling occurred over multiple years. 

X = Central longitude of the study area (decimal degrees)

Y = Centra latitude of the study area (decimal degrees)

Xmin = Westernmost longitude of the study area

Xmax = Easternmost longitude of the study area

Ymin = Northernmost latitude of the study area

Ymax = Southernmost latitude of the study area

Site = Name of the study site (also reporting region, island name, etc..)

Country = Name of the country

Sampling_area = The smallest sampling unit. If data were collected over the whole study area (e.g. mark-recapture, census) it corresponds to the study area. If data were collected within smaller areas (e.g. plots, strip transects) it corresponds to their size

Sampling_area_unit = Unit measurement of the sampling area

Density = Population density estimate

Density_unit = Unit measurement for the population density estimate

SE = Standard error of the density estimate

SD = Standard deviation of the density estimate

CI90 = 90% confidence intervals of the density estimate

CI95 = 95% confidence intervals of the density estimate

CV = Coefficient of variation of the density estimate expressed as percentage

Method = Sampling method category: Census = Any count that assumes all individuals were counted (e.g. aerial census); Counts = any incomplete count extrapolated on a larger area (e.g. strip transect counts, plot counts); Distance_sampling = Estimates based on distance sampling methods (e.g. line transects or point counts); Distance_sampling_corrected = Distance sampling estimates where g(0) ≠ 1, i.e. detectability at distance = 0 can be lower than 1 (e.g. aquatic mammals); Encounter_Models = Camera-trap models based on animal movement and frequency of encounters; Home_range =  Density estimated as the inverse of the home range area (1/home range area), in some cases accounting for group size, home range overlap, etc..; Mark_recapture =  Any estimate obtained on mark-recapture methods (genetic, camera traps, classical, etc.); Spatial_Capture_Recapture = Capture-recapture approaches modeling the spatial heterogeneity in detectability of individuals as a function of the distance from their activity centers; Mixture_Models = Models combining a model for probability of detection and one for estimating abundance from count data; Minimum_Number_Alive = any estimate based on the minimum number of animals observed (e.g. trapping studies). 

Method2 = Sub-category of method as reported in Table 2.

Notes_method = Free-format field where additional notes related to the method are reported

Habitat = Descriptive field of the habitat type

Season = Period of sampling expressed in seasons (e.g. Dry seasons, Fall) or months (e.g. February – April). If both are available, only months are reported

Native = Indicates if the species is native to the area

Notes = Additional useful notes that do not fit in other fields

Reference = Reference of the study reported in APA format
